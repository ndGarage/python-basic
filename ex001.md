# Exercise 001

This introduces a series of simple exercises to use ```for```, ```range```, and ```if``` in python.

You are going to using [repl.it](https://repl.it/) with your browser for easy setup.

* Step1: click the blue button of ```+ new repl``` at the right-top corner.
* Step2: choose python as your programming language.
* Step3: click the button to create the repl.

Copy and paste the following code into the repl.it and then click the button of run.

Comments are staring with a ```#```.

```
for v in range(5):  # for loop
  print(v, end='')  # print the value of v without a new line
print('\n')         # print a new line
```

You should be able to see ```01234``` is printed with an orange prompt in the next window.

Then we are going to print something like the below.

```
01234
12345
23456
34567
45678
```

with the following code.

```
for row in range(5):
  for column in range(5):
    print(row+column, end='')
  print('\n')
```

what is the result of the following code?

```
for row in range(5):
  for column in range(5):
    print('*', end='')
  print('\n')
```

There are a few things we need to a simple introduction.

Both ```for``` and ```in``` are the keywords in Python.
Both ```range``` and ```print``` are the function names.
Both ```row``` and ```column``` are variables in Python.

Let's make the square bigger.

```
for row in range(10):
  for column in range(10):
    print(row+column, end='')
  print('\n')
```

What we have now is:

```
0123456789
12345678910
234567891011
3456789101112
45678910111213
567891011121314
6789101112131415
78910111213141516
891011121314151617
9101112131415161718
```

It doesn't look nice. We could use ```if``` to add one space for single-digit number to make it better.

```
for row in range(10):
  for column in range(10):
    if (row+column) < 10:
      print(' ', end='')
    print(row+column, end='')
  print('\n')
```

Note that we have added two new lines starting with ```if``` in the above code. The result is better.

```
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 91011
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9101112
 4 5 6 7 8 910111213
 5 6 7 8 91011121314
 6 7 8 9101112131415
 7 8 910111213141516
 8 91011121314151617
 9101112131415161718
```

Still we could make it better by adding a hyphen between the numbers.

```
 0- 1- 2- 3- 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9
 1- 2- 3- 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9-10
 2- 3- 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9-10-11
 3- 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9-10-11-12
 4- 5- 6- 7- 8- 9-10-11-12-13
 5- 6- 7- 8- 9-10-11-12-13-14
 6- 7- 8- 9-10-11-12-13-14-15
 7- 8- 9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16
 8- 9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17
 9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18
```

The answer is here:

```
for row in range(10):
  for column in range(10):
    if (row+column) < 10:
      print(' ', end='')
    print(row+column, end='')
    if column < 9:
      print('-', end='')
  print('\n')
```

## Section II

How about the following?
 
```
for row in range(5):
  for space in range(4-row):
    print(' ', end='')
  for number in range(2*row+1):
    print(2*row+1, end='')
  print('\n')
```

You should have something below:

```
    1
   333
  55555
 7777777
999999999
```

Let's have a triangle here.

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

You know how to change the code, right?

Just replace ```2*row+1``` with ```"*"``` inside the second print.

Can you code to print an up-side-down triangle?

```
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```

The answer is as below.

```
for row in range(5):
  for space in range(row):
    print(' ', end='')
  for number in range(2*(4-row)+1):
    print('*', end='')
  print('\n')
```
